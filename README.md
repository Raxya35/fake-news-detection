Nepali Fake News Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms:
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms( Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, and SVM) to detect fake news in the Nepali language. It consists of a frontend, backend, and an ML model to classify news articles as real or fake.

Project Overview
Frontend: A user interface for inputting Nepali news articles to be classified.
Backend: Handles requests, processes data, and interacts with the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Model: Trained on Nepali language news data to predict whether an article is real or fake.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: Django( Python)
ML Model: Python, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

Key Features
Classifies Nepali news articles in real-time.
Trained with machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and SVM.
Simple and intuitive user interface.
